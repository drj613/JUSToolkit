## Human Testing Required

> **AGENTS**: When you need in-game verification, add items here AND to the central
> queue at `docs/research/Human-Testing-Queue.md`. Format: `[CHARACTER] - [TEST]`

### Pending Tests

| Test ID    | Test Description           | Priority | Status    | Result |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ |
| dg_b_01-001| Verify available koma sizes| P2       | PENDING   |        |
| dg_b_01-002| Test all B move damage     | P2       | PENDING   |        |

**Priority Guide:** P0=Blocking other work, P1=High value, P2=Standard, P3=Nice to have

**Status:** PENDING | IN PROGRESS | DONE | NOT POSSIBLE

### Specific Tests Needed

1. **Move Damage Values**
   - [ ] B move damage (neutral, no buffs)
   - [ ] fwd B damage
   - [ ] up B damage (count hits if multi-hit)
   - [ ] down B damage
   - [ ] Y combo full damage breakdown (per hit)
   - [ ] fwd Y / up Y / down Y damage
   - [ ] All X move damage at each koma size

2. **Movement/Physics**
   - [ ] Walk speed observation (compare to Goku=standard, Nami=fast, Franky=slow)
   - [ ] Dash type (standard or flash)
   - [ ] Weight feel (compare knockback received vs Goku)

3. **Unique Mechanics**
   - [ ] Any buffs or special states
   - [ ] Damage type verification (use Slash Defense / Impact Defense passives)

## Unknown / Needs Research

### Unverified Data

1. Exact koma sizes available in deck builder
2. All move damage values
3. Sprite archive sizes

### Missing Information

- [ ] Complete move damage values (needs human testing)
- [ ] All koma size special damage scaling (needs human testing)
- [ ] Buff multipliers (needs human testing)
- [ ] Weight/displacement velocity location in files
- [ ] Walk speed storage location

### Open Questions

1. Does Allen have any Innocence transformation mechanics?
2. Are Allen and Lenalee's damage values identical due to shared jpower block?
